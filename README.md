# Purpose
This repository was used in a demo of Test-Driven Development (TDD). There were
a few core ideas presented in that demo, which the comments in this repository
hopefully explain. The main few are written in the list below.

1. Write specific tests in order to produce more general code.
2. Write a single, failing test, then implement minimal code to make it pass.
3. Write to the Transformation Priority Premise (TPP) to produce simple code.
